### Intro to R: welcome to the universe

Data is essential for accounting professionals. We are opening up a series of workshops to introduce hands-on skills to work with data with current day tools.
We are starting with R and introduce this amazing tool with a simple practical business case!

We will look into some very useful packages like Tidyverse which is immensely powerful for
data manipulation, visualisation and data analysis.

The Intro to R series is designed to open the doors to the world of data analytics!

Using the opensource cloud computing platform you will be coding in minutes.

You will gain hands on experience with packages designed to clean and organise, filter, summarise, arrange and transform your data and effortlessly create stunning visualisations to communicate insights to your stakeholders.

Join us to learn how Râ€™s ability to handle large volumes of data, combined with these tools can empower you to efficiently structure, clean, manipulate, analyse and structure your data.
